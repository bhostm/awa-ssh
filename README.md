### Awá SSH library.

[awa-ssh](http://www.github.com/haesbaert/awa-ssh) is an
_ISC-licensed_ SSH library implementation in ocaml.

The goal is to provide a purely functional SSH implementation for embedding on
servers or building clients. The former will be the first to be developed, this
will make it possible to embed SSH interfaces into unikernels, like
[mirage](https://mirage.io).

This is a work in progress software.

The name `awá` is a reference to the critically endangered indigenous people of
Brazil.
